# Getting Started with AI-Assisted Development

## Introduction

AI tools can significantly accelerate software development when used effectively. This guide will help you get started.

## Prerequisites

- An IDE or code editor (VS Code, Cursor, etc.)
- Access to AI coding tools (GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.)
- Basic understanding of your programming language

## Step 1: Choose Your Tools

Select the AI tools that best fit your workflow:

- **VS Code + GitHub Copilot**: Great for inline suggestions and chat
- **Cursor**: AI-first editor with powerful multi-file editing
- **Claude**: Excellent for complex reasoning and code review

## Step 2: Configure Your Environment

1. Install necessary extensions or applications
2. Configure settings for optimal AI assistance
3. Set up project-specific rules and guidelines

## Step 3: Learn Effective Prompting

- Be specific about what you want
- Provide context and examples
- Iterate on responses
- Review and test all generated code

## Step 4: Integrate into Your Workflow

Start small:
1. Use AI for simple tasks (writing tests, documentation)
2. Gradually expand to more complex tasks
3. Develop your own prompting patterns
4. Share learnings with your team

## Best Practices

- Always review AI-generated code
- Use AI as a collaborator, not a replacement
- Keep security and quality standards high
- Maintain coding standards and style guides

## Next Steps

- Explore the `/prompts` directory for example prompts
- Review `/skills` for specific techniques
- Check `/agents` for specialized AI configurations

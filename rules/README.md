This directory contains rules and guidelines for AI-assisted development.

## What are Rules?

Rules are constraints and guidelines that help AI tools generate better code that matches your project standards. They can be:

- Coding standards and style guides
- Project-specific conventions

## Using Rules

### Project-Level Rules

Create a `.cursorrules` or similar file in your project root:

```

### File-Type Rules

Apply different rules for different file types or directories.

### Team Rules

Share rules across your team for consistency.

## Rule Format

Each rule should:
1. Be clear and specific
2. Explain the "why" when not obvious
3. Provide examples
4. Be enforceable

## Examples

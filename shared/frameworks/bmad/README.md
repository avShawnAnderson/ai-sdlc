# BMAD Framework

This directory contains examples and best practices for using AI with the BMAD (Business Modeling and Development) framework.

## About BMAD

BMAD is a framework for business modeling and application development. It focuses on:

- Business process modeling
- Domain-driven design
- Model-driven development
- Business rule management

## AI Integration

AI tools can help with BMAD by:

1. **Model Generation**: Creating business models from requirements
2. **Code Generation**: Generating implementation from models
3. **Documentation**: Creating comprehensive documentation
4. **Validation**: Checking model consistency and completeness

## Using AI with BMAD

### Model Creation

Prompt AI to help design business models:

```
Create a BMAD business model for [domain/process].
Include:
- Entities and their relationships
- Business rules
- Process flows
- Validation rules
```

### Code Generation

Generate code from BMAD models:

```
Generate implementation code for this BMAD model:
[PASTE MODEL]

Target language: [language]
Framework: [framework]
```

### Documentation

Create documentation from models:

```
Generate comprehensive documentation for this BMAD model including:
- Entity descriptions
- Business rules
- Process flows
- API specifications
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Clear Requirements**: Ensure business requirements are well-defined
2. **Validate Models**: Review AI-generated models for accuracy
3. **Iterate**: Refine models based on feedback
4. **Maintain Traceability**: Keep requirements linked to models
5. **Version Control**: Track model changes over time

## Examples

See the examples in this directory for practical demonstrations of using AI with BMAD.
